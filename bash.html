		 	My Dearest Joanne,
		 	<br>
		 	Every day in the office feels a little brighter because of you. Even in the middle of deadlines, reports, and endless tasks, your presence makes everything lighter <span class="word"> The way you smile, the way you laugh, </span> creates new files that create problems. Your smile <span class="word"> even the small things you do </span> it all has a way of making me look forward to each workday. <span class="word"> I know </span>
		 	<br>
		 	our officemates sometimes tease us, but honestly, I don’t mind. <span class="word"> Even if they tease you, for me, you’re the most beautiful girl for me, </span> officemates or not. Those little moments only remind me how lucky I am to sit near you, <span class="word"> to share conversations, and to feel your warmth in the middle of ordinary days. </span> Joanne, <span class="word">scp </span> you’ve become the reason why I want to do better, why I push myself harder, and why I leave the office each day with a smile on my face.
		 	<br>
		 	But more than that, you’ve captured my heart in a way no one else ever has. When I see you, it feels like time slows down, <span class="word"> and even the busiest office </span> becomes the most peaceful place in the world.
		 	<br>
		 	I want to be the one who supports you, <span class="word"> I want to be the one who supports you, </span> makes you laugh after a long day, and reminds you every single moment how special you truly are. 
		 	I want to be the hand you hold when days feel heavy, and the heart that beats
		 	<br>
		 	only for you.
		 	<br>
		 	Bye.
		 	<br>
		 	Secret
			</p>
